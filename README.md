A) preparing coriander chutney

1. Take 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves, ½ tsp chaat masala powder, 1 to 2 green chilies (chopped) in a chutney grinder jar. I usually add 2 to 3 green chilies as we prefer a bit spicy chutney in the sandwiches. You can also add half-half of coriander leaves and mint leaves. Just add a pinch or two of salt as chaat masala already has salt in it.

2. Grind the chutney ingredients till smooth. no need to add water. But if you cannot grind, then add 1 or 2 tsp of water. I did not add water as there was enough moisture after rinsing the coriander leaves to help them grind to a smooth chutney.

3. Collect the coriander chutney in a bowl. Check the taste and add more salt if required. Cover and keep the chutney aside if you are making sandwiches immediately or else refrigerate.

Preparing vegetables

1. Steam or boil 1 medium beetroot and 2 small to medium potatoes in steamer or pressure cooker. If pressure cooking, then cook them for 2 whistles.

2. Thinly slice the other vegetables like 1 medium tomato, 1 small to medium onion and 1 medium cucumber. Before slicing the cucumber to get the bitterness out from it, follow this step – just slice the top part first. Then give a few slits to the cucumber on top with a knife. Rub the top sliced part with the rest of the cucumber. You will see a froth like substance on cucumber. Doing this method gets rid of the bitterness in the cucumber. Slice the frothy part of the cucumber. Rinse and peel it and then thinly slice.

2. Use a good quality fresh bread. If you have a loaf then slice them equally. Here I used homemade white bread. You can slice the edges if you want. I have not since I was using homemade bread and the slices were soft. You can also use whole wheat bread or brown bread or multigrain bread.

3. Spread butter very well on 8 to 10 slices. Make sure there is a good coating of butter as otherwise if you spread the chutney, then the bread slices can become soggy. You can use both salted as well unsalted butter. The butter should be softened and at room temperature.
